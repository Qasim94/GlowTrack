Great! Targeting skin-conscious users aged 16–35, mostly female but also inclusive of males, gives us a clear direction:

Tone: Smart, modern, slightly playful, but trustworthy.

Appeal: Aesthetic skin lovers, self-care junkies, wellness-focused folks.

Vibe: Think "glow-up culture" meets "data-driven skincare".

Here are refined, easy, catchy name ideas tailored for your audience:

🌟 Top 10 Brand-Ready Names

GlowTrack – simple, aesthetic, and clear.

SkinSync – sleek and techy, suggests tracking and balance.

FaceFlow – evokes a healthy skin routine, natural balance.

Glowver – from “glow” + “lover”; cute and brandable.

Dermly – modern, app-sounding, like “Calm” or “Fitbit”.
